If you're opening this, you fucked up with your 
Debian installation, and your past version is helping you
to fix everything.

First of all, check if every basic feature is fine.
Follow this link:
  http://linuxgeekar.blogspot.com.br/2015/05/things-to-do-after-installing-debian.html

Make the recommended steps for sources and etcetera

recover your dropbox!
if after all these steps your bluetooth doesn't work fine
recover it's firmware, probably "firmware-atheros"

at this point, if you didn't installed chrome, it's not a problem, we'll use
firefox to add plugins on debian and, if you trully remember, doing it without
firefox is piece of fuckin' shit.

If it isn't installed, install.
If it isn't enable, do it.
Plugin List:
  Alternate Tab
  AutoMove Windows
  Hide TopBar (optional)
  OpenWeather
  PixelSaver
  ShellTile
  TaskBar
  Todo List
  Workspace grid(VERY IMPORTANT)
  Workkspace Indicator
  
Configure it's commands on related menu or keyboard shortcuts.

Fix Brightness control:
  Everytime you reinstall Debian you need to fix this, so:
  change line with:
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=...

  to this line:
    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pcie_aspm=force acpi_backlight=vendor"

That's it. All Issues fixed.
