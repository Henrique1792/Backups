# Backups
  Possible Necessary Backups - vim configurations and etcetera.

Attention:
  1) The guide for fixing things on Debian Jessie exists due to some issues
  I got. It's a "HELP ME FIX MY DISTRO" kind of thing.

  2)vimrc_visual.txt contains my actual(12/17/16) vim configuration. It may suffer changes
  but, as repo specifies, it's a backup.
  
  3) Any Observations, please contact freitash1792@gmail.com
